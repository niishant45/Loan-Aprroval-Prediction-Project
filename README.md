Overview
Loan eligibility determination is a critical step for financial institutions. The Loan Prediction System uses machine learning to classify loan applications as approved or denied based on parameters like income, credit history, and loan amount. This project offers a modular, scalable solution that can easily be integrated into existing systems.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
Model Training: Uses a machine learning model for loan eligibility prediction.
Analysis-Ready Output: Combines test data with predicted values in a single DataFrame for better interpretability.
Scalability: Designed for easy extension with additional features or datasets.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-prediction-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd loan-prediction-system
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset and place it in the data/ folder.
Run the main script to start the loan prediction process:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
After execution, the system will:
Predict loan statuses for the test data.
Generate a combined DataFrame (X_test_df) with test features and predicted values.
View the output in the terminal:
python
Copy code
print(X_test_df.head())
Optionally, save the predictions to a CSV file for external analysis:
python
Copy code
X_test_df.to_csv('loan_predictions.csv', index=False)
Dataset
The dataset should include features such as ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, and Credit_History.
Ensure the dataset is saved in the data/ folder before running the script.

Key Metrics:
Model Accuracy: XX%
Techniques Used: Feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
Future Scope
Integrate with a web-based interface for real-time predictions.
Use advanced algorithms (e.g., ensemble methods, deep learning) for better accuracy.
Visualize results with interactive dashboards.
Expand compatibility with multiple datasets and languages.
